How Programs Run
    main components of a computer

                        processor                       single core processors can execute one instruction at a time
                            ^
                            |
        input deviecs ->    |     ->  output devices    a process is a program in execution, stored in main memory
                            |
                            v
                        main memory

                            ^
                            v

                        secondary memory

    source code is in seconday memory (physical drive)
    the compiler is in the seconday memory
    binary executable file is in the secondary memory

    the binary executable file is loaded into main memory
    the processor brings the instructions from the main memory to the processor

    the executable holds both instructions and data

    when the program terminates, the main memory is released
