Question 1:
-----------
int i = 0;
for (i; i < 10; ++i) {
    std::cout << i << std::endl;
}
std::cout << i << std::endl;

Question 2:
-----------
To make the for loop infinite, removing the ++i increment
would mean i would never reach 10, therefore the loop would never meet
the termination condition.

Question 3:
-----------
the counter i is incremented in the for statement parameters,
but only after it is deincremented in the for loop body, meaning the
loop runs forever at i = 0.

Question 4:
-----------
The continue statement following the if conditional does not break the
loop once i == 10, as the continue statement is used to skip the rest
of a loop, but the loop itself continues. To fix, swap continue with
break.

Question 5:
-----------
This program doesn't print anything. This is because the program only
prints i as an ouput if it is equal to 9 after the for loop finishes.
The way that it is constructed, the for loop does nothing but
incrememnt i, but it increments it all the way to 10, at which point
the conditional test is failed and the loop ends. In order to get an
output, the conditional statement of the for loop should be i < 9.

Question 6:
-----------
The program in question doesn't run the while loop, as the condition
!i is nonsencical. In order for the output to print, the condition of
the while loop has to be while (true).

Question 7:
-----------
There is no output for this program, it does not include a print
statement.
