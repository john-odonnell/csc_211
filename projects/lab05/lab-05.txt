Lab 05: Debuggers and Functions

Question 1:
-----------
The current value of x is reported as 32767. This value is
a representation of the data stored at the location x before
the program runs.

Question 2:
-----------
The debugger traced the program similarly to how a human
user would trace the program, aside from the value spike
that x experiences upon instantiaion.

Question 3:
-----------
A 3 was printed out to the console. This comes from the
result vairable being instantiated to 0, then altered by
the plus_one function being passed 0, which returns 1,
and then altered again by the plus_two function being
passed result, which in turn calls plus_one with result
+ 1 being passed as an argument, which returns 3.

Question 4:
-----------
I was not surprised by the activity of the stack on pythonTutor.

Question 5:
-----------
The return type of the main function is an integer.

Question 6:
-----------
You don't have to pass any parameters to the main function,
however the default parameters are int argc and char *argv[]
and are passed to the main function by the compiler.

Question 7:
-----------
Returning void means that the function doesn't return anything.

Question 8:
-----------
Void functions are incapable of returning values.

Question 9:
-----------
The void function run() was not declared before it was used in
the main() function.

Question 10:
------------
